Package `swag` contains a bunch of helper functions for go-openapi and go-swagger projects.

You may also use it standalone for your projects.

> `swag` is one of the foundational building blocks of the go-openapi initiative.

> Most packages in `github.com/go-openapi/...` depend on it in some way.
> So does the CLI tool `github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger`,

## Contents

Here is what is inside:

*	Package `conv`

  * [x] convert between values and pointers for any types
  * [x] convert from string to builtin types (wraps `strconv`)

*	Package `fileutils`

  * [x] file upload type
  * [x] search in path (depracated)

* Package `jsonname`

  * [x] infer JSON names from go properties

* Package `jsonutils`

  * [x] fast json concatenation
  * [x] read and write JSON from and to dynamic go data structures

* Package `loading`

  * [x] load from file or http

* Package `mangling`

  * [x] name mangling for go

* Package `netutils`

  * [x] host, port from address

*	Package `stringutils`

  * [x] search in slice (with case-insensitive)
  * [x] slit/join query parameters as arrays

*	Package `typeutils`

  * [x] check the zero value for any type

* Package `yamlutils`

  * [x] converting YAML to JSON
  * [x] loading YAML into a dynamic YAML document

This repo has a few dependencies outside of the standard library:

* YAML utilities depend on `gopkg.in/yaml.v3`
* JSON utilities `github.com/mailru/easyjson`

## Release notes

### v0.24.0

With this release, we have largely modernized the API of `swag`:
* The traditional `swag` API still works the same: code that imports `swag` will still
  compile and work the same.
* A deprecation notice is published to encourage consumers of this library to adopt
  the newer API:
  * configuration through global variables is now deprecated, in favor of options passed as parameters
  * helper functions are moved to more specialized packages, which are exposed as 
    go modules. Importing such a module would reduce the footprint of dependencies.

Moving forward, no additional feature will be added to the `swag` API directly.
However, child modules will continue to evolve or some new ones may be added in the future.

**New with this release**:

* [x] type converters and pointer to value helpers now support generic types
* [x] name mangling now support pluralized initialisms (issue #46)
  Strings like "contact IDs" are now recognized as such a plural form and
* [x] performance: small improvements to reduce the overhead of convert/format wrappers (see issues #110, or PR #108)
* [x] performance: name mangling utilities run ~ 10% faster (PR #115)

## Todos, suggestions and plans
